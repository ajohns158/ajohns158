- 👋 Hi, I’m Jola
- 👀 I’m a data analyst interested in healthcare data and bioinformatics 
- 🌱 Currently learning Power BI, SQL, and Python. I'm currently working on projects
      to develop and display my skills. 
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate with anyone willing to trade skills and insights on how to approach
    new data.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Outside of data analytics I  enjoy music and art. I've played the violin for 8 years
      and taught myself the guitar.
